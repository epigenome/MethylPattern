# MethylPattern
MethylPattern is a software package for BS-seq analysis on GenePattern which is one of workflow systems for bioinformatics.

1) BSpipe.Index creates indices for mapping bisulfite reads
2) BSpipe.Mapping maps bisulfite reads to a reference
3) BSpipe.WindowMethylation quantifies the methylation level for sliding windows
4) BSpipe.Correlation measures Pearson or Spearman scores for sites or windwos 
5) BSpipe.Clustering perform the hierarchical, k-means, or PAM clustering for sites or windows
6) BSpipe.DifferentialMethylation identifies differentially methylated sites or windows
7) BSpipe.Annotation annotates differentially methylated sites or windows with UCSC known genes, refseq genes, CpG islands, repeats, SNPs, and so on.
8) BSpipe.UCSCBrowser generates the fiels needed for visualization on the UCSC genome browse.
